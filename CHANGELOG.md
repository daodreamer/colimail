### Improved
- **Context Menu System**: Implemented comprehensive right-click context menu functionality with global state management
  - **Global Context Menu State Management**: Ensures only one context menu can be open at a time across the entire application
    - Implemented centralized state in `+page.svelte`: `openContextMenuType` (folder/email/null) and `openContextMenuId`
    - All context menus (folders and emails) share this global state via `onContextMenuChange` callback
    - Opening any context menu automatically closes all others, preventing multiple overlapping menus
    - Clean architecture: parent component manages global state, child components use derived state to check if their menu is open
  - **Global Browser Context Menu Disabled**: Blocked browser's default right-click menu for professional appearance
    - Added global `contextmenu` event listener in `+layout.svelte` with `preventDefault()`
    - Ensures only custom shadcn-svelte ContextMenu appears throughout the application
  - **Email List Context Menu**: Added right-click menu for email items with contextually relevant actions
    - Right-click any email to access quick actions without selecting it first
    - Menu options dynamically adapt based on email state:
      - "Open Email" (Mail icon) - Opens the full email content
      - "Mark as Read" (Eye icon) - Shows only for unread emails
      - "Mark as Unread" (EyeOff icon) - Shows only for read emails
      - "Add/Remove Star" (Star icon) - Toggle flagged status
      - "Delete Email" (Trash2 icon, destructive styling) - Move to trash or permanently delete
    - Smart menu management: Only one context menu can be open at a time
    - Controlled component pattern: `openContextMenuUid` tracks currently open menu by email UID
    - Auto-closes previous menu when opening a new one
    - Menu closes automatically after action selection
    - All actions use optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
  - **Folder Context Menu**: Right-click menu for folder operations
    - Prevents accidental deletion when clicking folders
    - Right-click any folder to reveal context menu with "Delete Folder" option
    - Uses shadcn-svelte ContextMenu component with destructive styling
    - Trash icon clearly indicates delete action
    - System folders remain protected (no context menu for Inbox, Sent, etc.)
    - Better user experience: intentional right-click vs accidental hover click
    - Smart menu management: Only one context menu can be open at a time
    - Auto-closes previous menu when opening a new one
    - Menu closes automatically when clicking delete action
- **Delete Account Notification**: Migrated from inline Alert component to toast notification for better UX
  - Replaced prominent green Alert card with non-intrusive `toast.success()` notification
  - Uses same format as official shadcn-svelte toast example with title and description
  - Toast message: "Account deleted successfully" with full account details in description
  - Consistent notification style across all account management operations
  - Cleaner UI without auto-dismissing alert banners taking up space
  - Removed unused state variables (`showSuccessAlert`, `deletedEmail`)
  - Removed unused icon import (`CheckCircle2Icon`)

### Technical Details
- **Context Menu Implementation**:
  - **Global State Management** (`src/routes/+page.svelte`):
    - Added state variables: `openContextMenuType: 'folder' | 'email' | null` and `openContextMenuId: string | number | null`
    - Created callback function: `onContextMenuChange(type, id)` passed to all components with context menus
    - Both `AccountFolderSidebar` and `EmailListSidebar` receive these props for coordinated state management
    - State updates are centralized, ensuring only one menu can be open globally
  - **Global Context Menu Disable** (`src/routes/+layout.svelte`):
    - `onMount` lifecycle hook registers global `contextmenu` event listener
    - Event handler calls `preventDefault()` to block browser's default menu
    - Cleanup function removes listener on component unmount
    - Allows shadcn-svelte ContextMenu to function while blocking browser menu
  - **Folder Context Menu** (`src/routes/components/AccountFolderSidebar.svelte`):
    - Receives `openContextMenuType`, `openContextMenuId`, and `onContextMenuChange` props
    - Derived function `isFolderContextMenuOpen(folderName)` checks if specific folder's menu is open
    - ContextMenu.Root `open` prop bound to derived state: `open={isFolderContextMenuOpen(folder.name)}`
    - `onOpenChange` callback updates global state via `onContextMenuChange(isOpen ? 'folder' : null, isOpen ? folder.name : null)`
    - All menu item clicks call `onContextMenuChange(null, null)` to close menu
  - **Email List Context Menu** (`src/routes/components/EmailListSidebar.svelte`):
    - Added imports: `ContextMenu` components, lucide-svelte icons (Mail, Trash2, Star, Eye, EyeOff)
    - New optional callback props: `onMarkAsRead`, `onMarkAsUnread`, `onDeleteEmail`, plus global state props
    - Receives `openContextMenuType`, `openContextMenuId`, and `onContextMenuChange` props for global coordination
    - Derived function `isEmailContextMenuOpen(uid)` checks if specific email's menu is open
    - ContextMenu.Root `open` prop bound to derived state: `open={isEmailContextMenuOpen(email.uid)}`
    - `onOpenChange` callback updates global state via `onContextMenuChange(isOpen ? 'email' : null, isOpen ? email.uid : null)`
    - Each email wrapped in `ContextMenu.Root` with controlled `open` state
    - Conditional menu items based on email state (seen/unseen)
    - Menu closes automatically via `onContextMenuChange(null, null)` after each action
    - Separator elements group related actions visually
    - Destructive styling for Delete action matches design system
  - **Parent Component Handlers** (`src/routes/+page.svelte`):
    - `handleMarkEmailAsRead(uid)`: Marks specific email as read with optimistic UI update
    - `handleMarkEmailAsUnread(uid)`: Marks specific email as unread with optimistic UI update
    - `handleDeleteEmailFromContextMenu(uid)`: Deletes email with confirmation for trash folder
    - All handlers use optimistic updates with rollback on error
    - Handlers passed to EmailListSidebar component props
    - Reuses existing IMAP commands: `mark_email_as_read`, `mark_email_as_unread`, `move_email_to_trash`
- **Folder Management Implementation** (`src-tauri/src/commands/folders.rs`):
  - UTF-7 encoding support for non-ASCII folder names (via `encode_folder_name` helper)
  - Capability detection using IMAP `capabilities()` command
  - IMAP CREATE/DELETE operations wrapped in `tokio::spawn_blocking` for async safety
  - Smart error handling with folder name cloning to avoid borrow checker issues
  - Automatic database migration for `is_local` column on existing installations
- **Folder UI Components** (`src/routes/components/AccountFolderSidebar.svelte`):
  - Dialog component for folder creation with real-time validation
  - AlertDialog component for deletion confirmation with destructive styling
  - ContextMenu component for right-click folder actions (replaces hover delete button)
  - Right-click context menu shows "Delete Folder" with Trash2Icon and destructive styling
  - Controlled ContextMenu state: `openContextMenuFolder` tracks currently open menu by folder name
  - `open` and `onOpenChange` props ensure only one menu is open at a time
  - Smart icon selection: HardDrive icon for local folders, standard icons for remote
  - `canDeleteFolder()` helper prevents deletion of system folders
  - Callbacks: `onFolderCreated` and `onFolderDeleted` for parent state refresh
- **Main Page Integration** (`src/routes/+page.svelte`):
  - `handleFolderCreated()`: Reloads folder list after creation
  - `handleFolderDeleted()`: Reloads folders and switches to Inbox if needed
  - Seamless integration with existing account/folder switching logic
- **Code Quality**:
  - All Rust code formatted with `cargo fmt`
  - Compiled without errors via `cargo check`
  - Zero Clippy warnings with `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
  - TypeScript/Svelte code validated with `svelte-check` (0 errors, 0 warnings)

## [0.4.2] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Local Draft Storage**: Implemented SQLite-based local draft storage system
  - **Problem Solved**: Gmail IMAP APPEND creates drafts invisible in web interface/other clients
  - **Root Cause**: Gmail API uses draft containers separate from IMAP message system
  - **Solution**: Store drafts locally in SQLite database instead of syncing to IMAP server
  - **Database Schema**: Added `drafts` table with columns: `id`, `account_id`, `to_addr`, `cc_addr`, `subject`, `body`, `attachments`, `draft_type`, `original_email_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - **Draft Types**: Supports three types - "compose" (new email), "reply" (reply to email), "forward" (forward email)
  - **Auto-save**: Drafts automatically saved every 3 seconds while composing
  - **Attachment Support**: Full attachment handling with file metadata preservation
  - **Commands**:
    - `save_draft`: Create or update draft in local database
    - `load_draft`: Retrieve draft with all metadata and attachments
    - `list_drafts`: List all drafts for an account
    - `delete_draft`: Remove draft from database
  - **Deletion on Send**: Drafts automatically deleted after successful email send

### Improved
- **Drafts UI Consistency**: Redesigned DraftsList component to match EmailListSidebar style
  - **Unified Layout**: Uses same Sidebar component structure as email folders
  - **Consistent Header**: Title + search box + pagination (identical to email list)
  - **Matching List Items**: Same two-row layout, hover effects, and selection highlighting
  - **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across subject, recipient, and CC fields
  - **Pagination Support**: 50 drafts per page with same pagination component
  - **Loading States**: Skeleton placeholders matching email list loading UI
  - **Draft Type Badges**: Color-coded badges - Reply (secondary), Forward (outline), Draft (default)
  - **Delete Button**: Trash icon appearing on hover, consistent with star icon pattern
  - **Time Formatting**: Uses same `formatLocalDateTime` utility as email list
  - **Visual Consistency**: Identical spacing, fonts, colors, and animations

- **Dialog UI Standardization**: Replaced system dialogs with shadcn-svelte components
  - **Confirm Delete Draft**: Custom `ConfirmDialog` component using AlertDialog
    - Professional modal with overlay and proper styling
    - Destructive variant with red "Delete" button for clarity
    - Clear warning message: "This action cannot be undone"
    - Replaces native `ask()` dialog for better UX
  - **Email Sent Success**: Changed from blocking `message()` dialog to toast notification
    - Non-intrusive success message using `toast.success()`
    - Doesn't interrupt user workflow
    - Consistent with other app notifications
  - **ConfirmDialog Component**: Reusable confirmation dialog
    - Props: `title`, `description`, `confirmText`, `cancelText`, `variant`
    - Supports `destructive` and `default` button styles
    - Two-way binding with `$bindable()` for `open` state
    - Clean API without `asChild` or `builders` complexity

### Fixed
- **IDLE Connection Limit**: Fixed "Too many simultaneous connections" error with Gmail
  - **Problem**: IDLE manager created connections for every folder (INBOX, Sent, Drafts, Important, Spam, Trash, etc.)
  - **Root Cause**: Each account with 9 folders created 9 IDLE connections, exceeding Gmail's 15 connection limit
  - **Solution**: Limited IDLE monitoring to INBOX folder only
  - **Implementation**: Modified `StartAllForAccount` command to filter for INBOX/收件箱 folders
  - **Impact**: Reduced connection count from 9+ per account to 1 per account
  - **Code Change**: Changed from `tasks.insert(key, task)` for all folders to conditional insertion only for INBOX
  - **Clippy Fix**: Changed `vec!["INBOX", "收件箱"]` to array `["INBOX", "收件箱"]` to avoid useless Vec allocation

### Technical Details
- **Draft Manager** (`src/routes/lib/draft-manager.ts`):
  - `saveDraft()`: Saves draft with account ID, recipients, subject, body, attachments, draft type
  - `loadDraft()`: Returns draft data with parsed attachments JSON
  - `listDrafts()`: Returns array of draft metadata for account
  - `deleteDraft()`: Removes draft by ID
  - `filesToDraftAttachments()`: Converts File objects to database-compatible format
  - `draftAttachmentsToFiles()`: Converts database attachments back to File objects
  - Auto-save debouncing with 3-second delay

- **Backend Commands** (`src-tauri/src/commands/drafts.rs`):
  - SQLite-based implementation using `sqlx` async database driver
  - Manual row mapping for `list_drafts` to handle `DraftType` enum deserialization
  - `DraftType` serialization using serde JSON with lowercase format
  - Foreign key constraint on `account_id` with CASCADE delete
  - Timestamps stored as Unix epoch integers

- **UI Components**:
  - `DraftsList.svelte`: Complete redesign matching EmailListSidebar
  - `ConfirmDialog.svelte`: Reusable confirmation dialog component
  - `AccountFolderSidebar.svelte`: Added Drafts button with FilePenIcon
  - Drafts folder toggle controlled by `appState.showDraftsFolder` state

- **Database Migration**:
  - Table creation in `db::init()` with IF NOT EXISTS guard
  - Supports both new installations and existing databases
  - No data loss for users upgrading from IMAP draft version

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Email Star/Flag Feature**: Implemented full email starring/flagging functionality with bidirectional sync
  - **UI Components**: Added star icon (⭐/☆) to email list for each email
  - **Click to Toggle**: Users can click star icon to mark/unmark emails as starred
  - **Bidirectional Sync**: Star status syncs between client and email server
    - Starring email in client updates server via IMAP `\Flagged` flag
    - Starring email in webmail (Gmail, etc.) syncs to client automatically
  - **IDLE Real-time Updates**: Uses IMAP IDLE `FlagsChanged` events for instant sync
  - **Performance Optimized**: Only syncs specific UID when flag changes detected (35x faster than full sync)
  - **Database Support**: Added `flagged` column to emails table for local caching
  - **Backend Commands**:
    - `mark_email_as_flagged`: Sets `\Flagged` flag on IMAP server and updates cache
    - `mark_email_as_unflagged`: Removes `\Flagged` flag on IMAP server and updates cache
    - `sync_email_flags`: Syncs all email flags in folder (used during incremental sync)
    - `sync_specific_email_flags`: Syncs single email flag efficiently (used for IDLE events)
  - **Accessibility**: Star button supports keyboard navigation (Enter/Space) and screen readers

### Improved
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Enhanced user experience with instant visual feedback for flag operations
  - **Zero Latency Response**: Star and read/unread status update immediately on click (0ms perceived delay)
  - **Smart Rollback**: Automatically reverts UI changes if server request fails
  - **Error Handling**: Shows clear error message and restores previous state on failure
  - **Network Independent**: UI updates before server responds, making app feel extremely responsive
  - **Consistent UX**: Applied optimistic update pattern to both star toggle and read/unread toggle
  - **Performance Impact**: Eliminates 500-1000ms perceived latency from user interactions
- **Flag Sync Performance**: Optimized flag synchronization strategy for large mailboxes
  - **Incremental Sync**: Background flag sync runs asynchronously during normal email sync
  - **Performance Metrics**: 217 emails synced in 1.7 seconds (1.65s IMAP + 0.02s database)
  - **Batched Fetching**: Processes flags in batches of 100 emails to avoid server overload
  - **Smart Detection**: Only updates database rows where flags actually changed
  - **IDLE Optimization**: FlagsChanged events trigger single-UID sync instead of full mailbox scan
  - **35x Speedup**: Single email flag sync takes ~0.05s vs 1.7s for full mailbox (tested on 217 emails)
  - **Detailed Logging**: Performance metrics logged for monitoring (IMAP time, DB time, changed count)

### Added
- **IMAP ID Command Support**: Implemented IMAP client identification for Chinese email providers
  - **Supported Providers**: 163.com (NetEase), 126.com, qq.com, sina.com, yeah.net, sohu.com
  - **Problem Solved**: "Unsafe Login. Please contact kefu@188.com" error when accessing 163.com folders
  - **RFC 2971 Compliance**: Sends IMAP ID command to identify client to mail server
  - **Client Information**: Identifies as "Colimail" with version number and vendor details
  - **Implementation**: Automatically sends ID command after authentication for Chinese mail providers
  - **Fallback Handling**: Continues authentication even if ID command fails (some servers don't support it)
  - **Technical Details**: Uses `Session::run_command_and_read_response()` public API method
  - **Provider Detection**: Smart domain matching to detect Chinese email providers automatically
  - **Security**: No sensitive information sent in ID command (only client name/version)
  - **Impact**: 163.com, 126.com, and other NetEase mailboxes now fully functional
- **IDLE Capability Detection**: Added automatic detection of IDLE support before attempting real-time monitoring
  - **Problem Solved**: "Bad Response: command not support" errors on servers without IDLE (e.g., 163.com)
  - **RFC 2177 Compliance**: Checks server CAPABILITIES before using IDLE extension
  - **Smart Detection**: Uses `capabilities.has_str("IDLE")` to verify server support
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Stops IDLE monitoring when server doesn't support it
  - **User Guidance**: Displays helpful message to use manual sync (Sync Mail button) instead
  - **No Infinite Loops**: Prevents endless reconnection attempts when IDLE is unsupported
  - **Impact**: 163.com and other servers without IDLE no longer spam error logs

### Fixed
- **SMTP Port 465 SSL/TLS Support**: Fixed SMTP connection failures for Chinese email providers using port 465
  - **Problem**: 163.com (NetEase) and other Chinese providers failed with "response error: incomplete response"
  - **Root Cause**: Code used STARTTLS for all SMTP ports, but port 465 requires direct SSL/TLS connection
  - **Port 465**: Direct SSL/TLS connection (implicit TLS) - used by 163.com, 126.com, QQ Mail, etc.
  - **Port 587**: STARTTLS connection (explicit TLS) - used by Gmail, Outlook, etc.
  - **Solution**: Auto-detect port and use appropriate connection method
    - Port 465: `AsyncSmtpTransport::relay()` with direct SSL/TLS
    - Port 587: `AsyncSmtpTransport::starttls_relay()` with STARTTLS upgrade
  - **Files Modified**: `test_connection.rs` and `send.rs` (all 3 functions: `send_email`, `reply_email`, `forward_email`)
  - **Impact**: Both OAuth2 and basic authentication now work correctly with port 465
  - **Testing**: Successfully tested with 163.com account (SMTP connection and email sending)
- **UTF-7 Folder Name Encoding**: Fixed issue where folders with non-ASCII names (German, French, Russian, Chinese, etc.) could not be accessed
  - **Problem**: Folders with special characters like German umlauts (ä, ö, ü) were being skipped with "unsupported folder name" error
  - **Root Cause**: IMAP uses Modified UTF-7 encoding for folder names (e.g., `Entw&APw-rfe` for "Entwürfe"), but code was using decoded UTF-8 names for SELECT operations
  - **Example**: GMX German folders `Entwürfe` (Drafts) and `Gelöscht` (Deleted) were inaccessible
  - **Solution**: Store raw UTF-7 encoded names in database `name` field for IMAP operations, while `display_name` contains decoded UTF-8 for UI display
  - **Impact**: Now supports folders in any language with special characters (German ä/ö/ü, French é/è/à, Spanish ñ, Russian Cyrillic, Chinese/Japanese characters)
  - **Technical**: Changed `folder.name` to store `raw_name` (UTF-7 encoded) instead of `decoded_name`, ensuring IMAP SELECT operations use correct encoding
- **Background BODYSTRUCTURE Fetch Retry Logic**: Fixed issue where failed emails were not retried during background attachment detection
  - **Problem**: When batch BODYSTRUCTURE fetch failed (e.g., connection error), the task would reconnect but skip failed emails entirely, leaving them with NULL `has_attachments` status
  - **Root Cause**: Error handling would `continue` to next batch without tracking failed UIDs, causing infinite "X emails pending" notifications on every folder click
  - **Solution**: Implemented two-tier retry mechanism
    - Track all failed UIDs during batch processing in `failed_uids` list
    - After batch loop completes, retry failed emails individually (one by one)
    - Connection errors during individual retry: reconnect and continue
    - Non-connection errors (e.g., malformed email structure): mark as "no attachments" to prevent infinite retry loops
  - **Impact**: Emails with problematic BODYSTRUCTURE (rare edge cases) no longer get stuck in pending state
  - **User Experience**: No more persistent "5 emails pending" messages that never resolve
  - **Reliability**: Background task now processes 100% of emails, even when encountering server disconnections or malformed messages

### Improved
- **Long-Running Connection Management**: Enhanced connection stability during bulk BODYSTRUCTURE processing
  - Preventive reconnection every 100 batches to avoid server-side timeout disconnections
  - Reactive reconnection on Bye/TagMismatch/Connection errors with 2-second retry delay
  - Graceful error recovery: break loop only if reconnection fails to prevent cascading errors
  - Successfully tested with 5000+ email processing without connection failures

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- **Email Provider Presets**: Added 13 pre-configured email provider presets for manual account configuration
  - Includes popular providers: Yahoo Mail, iCloud Mail, Zoho Mail, ProtonMail, Fastmail, GMX, AOL, QQ Mail, 163 Mail, 126 Mail, Sina Mail
  - Custom option for advanced users to configure any email provider
  - Combobox component with search functionality for easy provider selection
  - Auto-fills IMAP/SMTP server addresses and ports when provider is selected
  - Reduces configuration errors and improves user experience
  - Each preset includes descriptive text (e.g., "Apple iCloud Mail (requires app-specific password)")
- **Connection Testing**: Implemented pre-validation connection test before account creation
  - Added "Test Connection" button to verify IMAP and SMTP settings
  - Tests both IMAP and SMTP connections independently
  - Visual feedback with green checkmarks (✓) for successful connections and red crosses (✗) for failures
  - Displays specific error messages if connection fails (e.g., authentication failure, server unreachable)
  - "Create Account" button only enables after successful connection test
  - Prevents users from adding non-functional accounts to the system
  - Async testing with loading state: "Testing Connection..." indicator
- **OAuth2 Email Input Validation**: Enhanced OAuth2 email input to prevent common mistakes
  - Automatically validates email format as user types
  - Prevents users from entering full email addresses like "username@gmail.com"
  - Users only need to enter username portion (e.g., "username")
  - System automatically appends provider domain (@gmail.com or @outlook.com)
  - Displays warning message when "@" symbol is detected in input
  - Reduces authentication errors caused by incorrect email format

### Improved
- **Add Account Dialog Layout**: Optimized manual configuration form for better visual hierarchy
  - Two-column layout: Email/Password fields on left, IMAP/SMTP settings on right
  - IMAP and SMTP server/port inputs displayed horizontally (server and port on same line)
  - Server address inputs use `flex-1` to automatically fill available space
  - Port inputs maintain fixed width (`w-20`) for consistent sizing
  - Reduced visual clutter and improved form compactness
  - Better utilization of dialog width for more efficient space usage

### Fixed
- **Email Date Parsing**: Resolved incorrect date display issue for emails with malformed or missing Date headers
  - **Root Cause**: Some emails have empty or invalid Date headers (e.g., future dates, missing Date field)
  - When Date header parsing failed, system used current time (`Utc::now()`) as fallback, showing email fetch time instead of actual email time
  - **Solution**: Implemented three-tier date parsing fallback mechanism
    1. First attempt: Parse standard Date header (RFC 2822/3339 formats)
    2. Second attempt: Use IMAP INTERNALDATE (server's received time) when Date header fails
    3. Last resort: Use current time only when both previous methods fail
  - Added INTERNALDATE to all FETCH commands: `"(UID ENVELOPE BODYSTRUCTURE FLAGS INTERNALDATE)"`
  - INTERNALDATE provides reliable server-side timestamp even when email's Date header is corrupted
  - Particularly fixes GMX inbox emails and other providers with unreliable Date headers
  - Example: Email with Date="Thu, 26 Jun 2025 09:34:37 +0200" (future date) now correctly shows INTERNALDATE="Sun, 31 Mar 2024 10:51:26 +0000" (actual receive time)
- **Attachment Detection in Email List**: Fixed attachment indicators not showing immediately when emails are fetched
  - **Root Cause**: Email sync operations skipped fetching BODYSTRUCTURE to avoid parsing issues with non-ASCII attachment filenames
  - Attachment detection only occurred when users clicked to open an email, causing paperclip icons (📎) to appear belatedly
  - **Solution**: Re-enabled BODYSTRUCTURE fetching during all sync operations (full sync, incremental sync, and initial sync)
  - Updated `parse_email_headers()` in `sync.rs` to use `check_for_attachments()` function on BODYSTRUCTURE data
  - Modified `save_emails_to_cache()` in `cache.rs` to properly persist `has_attachments` flag to database
  - IMAP FETCH command updated from `"(UID ENVELOPE FLAGS INTERNALDATE)"` to `"(UID ENVELOPE BODYSTRUCTURE FLAGS INTERNALDATE)"`
  - Attachment indicators now display immediately in email list upon sync, matching behavior of direct fetch operations
  - Users can see which emails have attachments without needing to open them first
  - `check_for_attachments()` uses debug format string matching which is immune to non-ASCII filename encoding issues

### Improved
- **Console Logging Optimization**: Reduced excessive debug output during email synchronization
  - **Email Cache Logging**: Changed `save_emails_to_cache()` to output single success message instead of logging each email individually
    - Before: `💾 Saving email UID XXX to cache` × N times (where N = number of emails)
    - After: `✅ Saved N emails to cache for folder XXX` (single message)
    - Error cases still output individual UID and error details for debugging
  - **Date Parsing Logging**: Silenced verbose date parsing messages for common scenarios
    - Emails with empty Date headers (`(No Date)`) no longer generate console output when INTERNALDATE succeeds
    - Only logs warnings when Date header has invalid content (not just empty)
    - Maintains detailed error logging when both Date and INTERNALDATE parsing fail
  - Result: Syncing 5000+ emails now produces clean, readable logs instead of thousands of repetitive messages

### Changed
- **CRITICAL: imap Crate Migration**: Upgraded from `imap 2.4.1` to `imap 3.0.0-alpha.15` to resolve critical limitations
  - **Motivation**: Version 2.4.1 had severe limitations with GMX email provider (500-email fetch limit) and crashes on complex BODYSTRUCTURE parsing
  - **Breaking Changes**: Complete API redesign requiring systematic migration of all IMAP operations
  - **Migration Scope**: Updated 12 connection points across 5 modules: `idle_manager.rs`, `fetch.rs`, `sync.rs`, `delete.rs`, `send.rs`
  - **Connection API**: 
    - Old: `Client::connect()` → `Client::secure_connect()`
    - New: `ClientBuilder::new(domain).native_tls().connect()` with builder pattern
    - Replaced tuple-based connection with explicit hostname/port parameters
    - Enhanced TLS configuration with native TLS connector support
  - **Session API**:
    - Old: `client.login(user, pass).ok()` returns `Option<Session>`
    - New: `client.login(user, pass)` returns `Result<Session, Error>`
    - Explicit error handling required for all login operations
  - **Fetch API**:
    - Old: `session.fetch()` with `mailparse` integration
    - New: Requires explicit fetching of `BODY[]` or `BODY.PEEK[]`
    - Message body no longer included by default in fetch operations
    - Enhanced lazy fetching for better performance on large mailboxes
  - **IDLE API**: Complete redesign following RFC 2177 specification
    - Old: `session.idle().wait_keepalive()` with manual loop
    - New: `session.idle()` returns `Handle` directly (no Result wrapper)
    - Uses `Handle::wait_while(callback)` with `FnMut(UnsolicitedResponse) -> bool` signature
    - Callback returns `true` to continue, `false` to stop monitoring
    - UnsolicitedResponse variants: `Exists`, `Recent`, `Expunge`, `Fetch`
    - Implemented smart detection: exits IDLE on `Exists` when new message count increases
    - Automatic 29-minute keepalive per RFC 2177 (built-in, no manual timer needed)
    - Removed legacy `detect_mailbox_changes()` helper function (logic now in callback)
  - **Folder Attributes**:
    - Old: Limited attribute access via `imap::types`
    - New: Full `NameAttribute` enum support via `imap-proto 0.16.4` dependency
    - Added `NoSelect` attribute checking for proper folder selectability validation
    - Fixed trash folder detection in `delete.rs` (replaced TODO workaround)
  - **Performance Improvements**:
    - Lazy body fetching reduces initial sync time by ~40%
    - GMX provider now supports fetching all emails (no 500-email limit)
    - No more BODYSTRUCTURE parsing crashes on complex multipart messages
    - IDLE notifications now more responsive with fine-grained UnsolicitedResponse handling

### Added
- **New Dependency**: `imap-proto = "0.16.4"`
  - Required for accessing `NameAttribute` enum not directly exported by imap crate
  - Provides low-level IMAP protocol types for advanced folder attribute checking
  - Used in `delete.rs` for `NoSelect` attribute detection

### Fixed
- **GMX Provider Compatibility**: Eliminated 500-email fetch limit imposed by imap 2.4.1
  - Users can now fetch complete email history from GMX accounts
  - No more artificial truncation of email list
- **BODYSTRUCTURE Crashes**: Resolved parsing failures on complex multipart messages
  - Application no longer crashes on emails with nested attachments or unusual MIME structures
  - Improved reliability when syncing mailboxes with diverse message formats
- **IDLE Reliability**: Fixed real-time notification system with proper RFC 2177 implementation

  - Proper handling of expunge events and flag changes
  - Reduced false positives in mailbox change detection
- **Folder Selection**: Fixed incorrect folder selectability checks in trash operations
  - Properly detects `\NoSelect` attribute to avoid selecting non-selectable folders
  - Prevents errors when attempting to move emails to parent/container folders

### Technical Details
- **Migration Pattern**: All IMAP connections now follow consistent builder pattern:
  ```rust
  let domain = format!("{}:{}", imap_host, imap_port);
  let tls = native_tls::TlsConnector::builder().build()
      .map_err(|e| format!("TLS error: {}", e))?;
  let client = ClientBuilder::new(&domain).native_tls(tls)
      .connect().map_err(|e| format!("Connection failed: {}", e))?;
  let session = client.login(username, password)
      .map_err(|e| format!("Login failed: {:?}", e))?;
  ```
- **IDLE Implementation**: Real-time notifications use callback-based pattern:
  ```rust
  let mut idle_handle = imap_session.idle();
  idle_handle.wait_while(|response| {
      match response {
          UnsolicitedResponse::Exists(count) => {
              if count > prev_exists {
                  // Emit notification, return false to stop
                  return false;
              }
          }
          _ => { /* Continue monitoring */ }
      }
      true
  })?;
  ```
- **Code Quality**: All changes validated with `cargo fmt`, `cargo check`, and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- **Documentation Reference**: Migration based on official imap 3.0.0-alpha.15 documentation from docs.rs

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-26

- Service name for keyring entries: `com.colimail.app`
- Maximum credential length: 1200 UTF-8 characters (accounts for UTF-16 encoding overhead)
- Credential key format: `{8-char-hash}:{field-type}` (e.g., `6bafc6a9:at` for access token)
- Field types: `pwd` (password), `at` (access_token), `rt` (refresh_token), `exp` (expiration), `email` (email mapping)
- Chunked credential format: `{key}:count` stores chunk count, `{key}:chunk{N}` stores each chunk
- Database schema updated: Removed `password` and OAuth2 token columns from `accounts` table
- Modified commands: `save_account_config`, `load_account_configs`, `delete_account_config`, `complete_oauth2_flow`, `ensure_valid_token`

## [0.1.4] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed database schema initialization issue on macOS causing "no such column: cc_addr" error
  - Moved all required columns (`cc_addr`, `has_attachments`, `flags`, `seen`) directly into CREATE TABLE statement
  - Ensured proper column initialization for fresh database installations
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing databases through migration statements
  - Issue primarily affected macOS M4 chip users with new installations
- **UI**: Fixed notification window positioning issue on macOS with Retina displays
  - **Root cause**: Used `PhysicalPosition` with logical coordinates, causing incorrect positioning on Retina displays
  - **Solution**: Changed to `LogicalPosition` to properly handle DPI scaling
  - Notification windows now correctly appear in bottom-right corner on all screen resolutions
  - Properly converts physical pixels (4096x2304) to logical pixels (2048x1152) for Retina displays
  - Uses appropriate coordinate system: logical coordinates for logical pixel calculations
  - Adjusted margins to 20px each for comfortable spacing above Dock/taskbar
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging (physical/logical dimensions, scale factor, window size)
