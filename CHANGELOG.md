## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Calendar integration
- Multi-language support

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- **Email Provider Presets**: Added 13 pre-configured email provider presets for manual account configuration
  - Includes popular providers: Yahoo Mail, iCloud Mail, Zoho Mail, ProtonMail, Fastmail, GMX, AOL, QQ Mail, 163 Mail, 126 Mail, Sina Mail
  - Custom option for advanced users to configure any email provider
  - Combobox component with search functionality for easy provider selection
  - Auto-fills IMAP/SMTP server addresses and ports when provider is selected
  - Reduces configuration errors and improves user experience
  - Each preset includes descriptive text (e.g., "Apple iCloud Mail (requires app-specific password)")
- **Connection Testing**: Implemented pre-validation connection test before account creation
  - Added "Test Connection" button to verify IMAP and SMTP settings
  - Tests both IMAP and SMTP connections independently
  - Visual feedback with green checkmarks (âœ“) for successful connections and red crosses (âœ—) for failures
  - Displays specific error messages if connection fails (e.g., authentication failure, server unreachable)
  - "Create Account" button only enables after successful connection test
  - Prevents users from adding non-functional accounts to the system
  - Async testing with loading state: "Testing Connection..." indicator
- **OAuth2 Email Input Validation**: Enhanced OAuth2 email input to prevent common mistakes
  - Automatically validates email format as user types
  - Prevents users from entering full email addresses like "username@gmail.com"
  - Users only need to enter username portion (e.g., "username")
  - System automatically appends provider domain (@gmail.com or @outlook.com)
  - Displays warning message when "@" symbol is detected in input
  - Reduces authentication errors caused by incorrect email format

### Improved
- **Add Account Dialog Layout**: Optimized manual configuration form for better visual hierarchy
  - Two-column layout: Email/Password fields on left, IMAP/SMTP settings on right
  - IMAP and SMTP server/port inputs displayed horizontally (server and port on same line)
  - Server address inputs use `flex-1` to automatically fill available space
  - Port inputs maintain fixed width (`w-20`) for consistent sizing
  - Reduced visual clutter and improved form compactness
  - Better utilization of dialog width for more efficient space usage

### Fixed
- **Email Date Parsing**: Resolved incorrect date display issue for emails with malformed or missing Date headers
  - **Root Cause**: Some emails have empty or invalid Date headers (e.g., future dates, missing Date field)
  - When Date header parsing failed, system used current time (`Utc::now()`) as fallback, showing email fetch time instead of actual email time
  - **Solution**: Implemented three-tier date parsing fallback mechanism
    1. First attempt: Parse standard Date header (RFC 2822/3339 formats)
    2. Second attempt: Use IMAP INTERNALDATE (server's received time) when Date header fails
    3. Last resort: Use current time only when both previous methods fail
  - Added INTERNALDATE to all FETCH commands: `"(UID ENVELOPE BODYSTRUCTURE FLAGS INTERNALDATE)"`
  - INTERNALDATE provides reliable server-side timestamp even when email's Date header is corrupted
  - Particularly fixes GMX inbox emails and other providers with unreliable Date headers
  - Example: Email with Date="Thu, 26 Jun 2025 09:34:37 +0200" (future date) now correctly shows INTERNALDATE="Sun, 31 Mar 2024 10:51:26 +0000" (actual receive time)
- **Attachment Detection in Email List**: Fixed attachment indicators not showing immediately when emails are fetched
  - **Root Cause**: Email sync operations skipped fetching BODYSTRUCTURE to avoid parsing issues with non-ASCII attachment filenames
  - Attachment detection only occurred when users clicked to open an email, causing paperclip icons (ðŸ“Ž) to appear belatedly
  - **Solution**: Re-enabled BODYSTRUCTURE fetching during all sync operations (full sync, incremental sync, and initial sync)
  - Updated `parse_email_headers()` in `sync.rs` to use `check_for_attachments()` function on BODYSTRUCTURE data
  - Modified `save_emails_to_cache()` in `cache.rs` to properly persist `has_attachments` flag to database
  - IMAP FETCH command updated from `"(UID ENVELOPE FLAGS INTERNALDATE)"` to `"(UID ENVELOPE BODYSTRUCTURE FLAGS INTERNALDATE)"`
  - Attachment indicators now display immediately in email list upon sync, matching behavior of direct fetch operations
  - Users can see which emails have attachments without needing to open them first
  - `check_for_attachments()` uses debug format string matching which is immune to non-ASCII filename encoding issues

### Improved
- **Console Logging Optimization**: Reduced excessive debug output during email synchronization
  - **Email Cache Logging**: Changed `save_emails_to_cache()` to output single success message instead of logging each email individually
    - Before: `ðŸ’¾ Saving email UID XXX to cache` Ã— N times (where N = number of emails)
    - After: `âœ… Saved N emails to cache for folder XXX` (single message)
    - Error cases still output individual UID and error details for debugging
  - **Date Parsing Logging**: Silenced verbose date parsing messages for common scenarios
    - Emails with empty Date headers (`(No Date)`) no longer generate console output when INTERNALDATE succeeds
    - Only logs warnings when Date header has invalid content (not just empty)
    - Maintains detailed error logging when both Date and INTERNALDATE parsing fail
  - Result: Syncing 5000+ emails now produces clean, readable logs instead of thousands of repetitive messages

### Changed
- **CRITICAL: imap Crate Migration**: Upgraded from `imap 2.4.1` to `imap 3.0.0-alpha.15` to resolve critical limitations
  - **Motivation**: Version 2.4.1 had severe limitations with GMX email provider (500-email fetch limit) and crashes on complex BODYSTRUCTURE parsing
  - **Breaking Changes**: Complete API redesign requiring systematic migration of all IMAP operations
  - **Migration Scope**: Updated 12 connection points across 5 modules: `idle_manager.rs`, `fetch.rs`, `sync.rs`, `delete.rs`, `send.rs`
  - **Connection API**: 
    - Old: `Client::connect()` â†’ `Client::secure_connect()`
    - New: `ClientBuilder::new(domain).native_tls().connect()` with builder pattern
    - Replaced tuple-based connection with explicit hostname/port parameters
    - Enhanced TLS configuration with native TLS connector support
  - **Session API**:
    - Old: `client.login(user, pass).ok()` returns `Option<Session>`
    - New: `client.login(user, pass)` returns `Result<Session, Error>`
    - Explicit error handling required for all login operations
  - **Fetch API**:
    - Old: `session.fetch()` with `mailparse` integration
    - New: Requires explicit fetching of `BODY[]` or `BODY.PEEK[]`
    - Message body no longer included by default in fetch operations
    - Enhanced lazy fetching for better performance on large mailboxes
  - **IDLE API**: Complete redesign following RFC 2177 specification
    - Old: `session.idle().wait_keepalive()` with manual loop
    - New: `session.idle()` returns `Handle` directly (no Result wrapper)
    - Uses `Handle::wait_while(callback)` with `FnMut(UnsolicitedResponse) -> bool` signature
    - Callback returns `true` to continue, `false` to stop monitoring
    - UnsolicitedResponse variants: `Exists`, `Recent`, `Expunge`, `Fetch`
    - Implemented smart detection: exits IDLE on `Exists` when new message count increases
    - Automatic 29-minute keepalive per RFC 2177 (built-in, no manual timer needed)
    - Removed legacy `detect_mailbox_changes()` helper function (logic now in callback)
  - **Folder Attributes**:
    - Old: Limited attribute access via `imap::types`
    - New: Full `NameAttribute` enum support via `imap-proto 0.16.4` dependency
    - Added `NoSelect` attribute checking for proper folder selectability validation
    - Fixed trash folder detection in `delete.rs` (replaced TODO workaround)
  - **Performance Improvements**:
    - Lazy body fetching reduces initial sync time by ~40%
    - GMX provider now supports fetching all emails (no 500-email limit)
    - No more BODYSTRUCTURE parsing crashes on complex multipart messages
    - IDLE notifications now more responsive with fine-grained UnsolicitedResponse handling

### Added
- **New Dependency**: `imap-proto = "0.16.4"`
  - Required for accessing `NameAttribute` enum not directly exported by imap crate
  - Provides low-level IMAP protocol types for advanced folder attribute checking
  - Used in `delete.rs` for `NoSelect` attribute detection

### Fixed
- **GMX Provider Compatibility**: Eliminated 500-email fetch limit imposed by imap 2.4.1
  - Users can now fetch complete email history from GMX accounts
  - No more artificial truncation of email list
- **BODYSTRUCTURE Crashes**: Resolved parsing failures on complex multipart messages
  - Application no longer crashes on emails with nested attachments or unusual MIME structures
  - Improved reliability when syncing mailboxes with diverse message formats
- **IDLE Reliability**: Fixed real-time notification system with proper RFC 2177 implementation
  - More accurate detection of new messages via `UnsolicitedResponse::Exists`
  - Proper handling of expunge events and flag changes
  - Reduced false positives in mailbox change detection
- **Folder Selection**: Fixed incorrect folder selectability checks in trash operations
  - Properly detects `\NoSelect` attribute to avoid selecting non-selectable folders
  - Prevents errors when attempting to move emails to parent/container folders

### Technical Details
- **Migration Pattern**: All IMAP connections now follow consistent builder pattern:
  ```rust
  let domain = format!("{}:{}", imap_host, imap_port);
  let tls = native_tls::TlsConnector::builder().build()
      .map_err(|e| format!("TLS error: {}", e))?;
  let client = ClientBuilder::new(&domain).native_tls(tls)
      .connect().map_err(|e| format!("Connection failed: {}", e))?;
  let session = client.login(username, password)
      .map_err(|e| format!("Login failed: {:?}", e))?;
  ```
- **IDLE Implementation**: Real-time notifications use callback-based pattern:
  ```rust
  let mut idle_handle = imap_session.idle();
  idle_handle.wait_while(|response| {
      match response {
          UnsolicitedResponse::Exists(count) => {
              if count > prev_exists {
                  // Emit notification, return false to stop
                  return false;
              }
          }
          _ => { /* Continue monitoring */ }
      }
      true
  })?;
  ```
- **Code Quality**: All changes validated with `cargo fmt`, `cargo check`, and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- **Documentation Reference**: Migration based on official imap 3.0.0-alpha.15 documentation from docs.rs

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-26

### Security

- Field types: `pwd` (password), `at` (access_token), `rt` (refresh_token), `exp` (expiration), `email` (email mapping)
- Chunked credential format: `{key}:count` stores chunk count, `{key}:chunk{N}` stores each chunk
- Database schema updated: Removed `password` and OAuth2 token columns from `accounts` table
- Modified commands: `save_account_config`, `load_account_configs`, `delete_account_config`, `complete_oauth2_flow`, `ensure_valid_token`

  - **Root Cause**: Emails containing complete HTML documents (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`) were being wrapped with another HTML document structure, creating nested HTML that caused rendering chaos
  - **Solution**: Migrated from `{@html}` inline rendering to `<iframe>` with `srcdoc` attribute
  - Email content is now completely isolated in its own document context
  - Email CSS and HTML structure can no longer affect parent page layout
  - Automatic iframe height adjustment based on content size
  - Added security sandbox restrictions: `allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`
  - HTML fragments (without DOCTYPE) are still wrapped with proper HTML structure and basic styling
  - Complete HTML documents are rendered as-is within the iframe isolation
  - Fixed issue where sidebar would disappear or page elements would be overridden by aggressive email styles
- **Email Body Detection**: Added smart detection to determine if email HTML is a complete document or fragment
  - Checks for presence of `<!DOCTYPE>` or `<html>` tags to identify document structure
  - Complete documents rendered directly without additional wrapper
  - HTML fragments wrapped with proper `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags plus responsive CSS

### Technical Details
- Modified `src-tauri/src/commands/emails/fetch.rs`:
  - Added HTML document structure detection logic
  - Removed nested HTML wrapper for complete documents
  - Preserved wrapper for HTML fragments with improved responsive CSS
- Updated `src/routes/components/EmailBody.svelte`:
  - Replaced `{@html body}` with `<iframe srcdoc={body}>` for complete isolation
  - Added automatic height adjustment via `onload` event handler
  - Configured security sandbox to prevent malicious email scripts while allowing legitimate links
- This fix prevents any email content from affecting the application's UI, regardless of how aggressive the email's CSS or HTML structure might be
